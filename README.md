🛠 Overview

Anomai Intent is a **demo wallet UI** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It simulates basic wallet functions without connecting to any real blockchain or handling real funds.  
Designed to showcase wallet features in a clean, compact interface.


🎯 Wallet Use Intent

The intent of this wallet is to provide a **clear, user-friendly demonstration** of how a crypto wallet might work.  
- To **educate new users** about wallet features (Swap, Bridge, Send, Receive, NFT).  
- To **prototype UI/UX flows** for decentralized applications (dApps).  
- To **test design concepts** without risking real funds.  
- To act as a **visual mockup** for developers, designers, and product teams.

**Note:** This project is **not a real wallet** and should not be used to manage real assets.
